# Project VR Guns
Is my attempt at recreating gun handling mechanics in VR. The following features have been implemented:
- Insert/eject magazine
- Pull pistol rack to chamber a round
- Pulling the pistol rack while a round is chambered ejects the round
- Slide lock when last round in chamber has been expended
- Firing the gun + Muzzle Flashes
- Shell casing particle systems

A demo video can be viewed on [youtube](https://youtu.be/4gKLL80wwU0) showcasing the above features.

### Note:
This project has currently been put on hold. May return to this at a later date...
